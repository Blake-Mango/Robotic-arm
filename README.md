# AI Robotic Arm
## Overview  
This project is using a few AI models from media pipe **object recognition** and **Gesture recognition** to be able to pick up what i point at and know what its holding and how far away things are from them. the main parts are 3d printed so small changes should be very easy to do.

## Key Features  
- **The AI:** Runs logic on a Raspberry Pi with a camera for real-time object and gesture recognition.  
- **Distance Sensing:** Ultrasonic distance detector for obstacle detection. 
- **3D-Printed Design:** Few parts, customizable, and easy to assemble and upgrade design.  
- **Servo Control** Uses a Teensy to control the servos.
  
## Assembly Notes  
1. Print parts in Pla or Petg minimum 15% infill.
2. dont over extend the arm.
3. Heres what it should look like assembled without the holder for the ultra sonic sensor and camera.
