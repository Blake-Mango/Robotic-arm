# Robotic-arm
I am going to try and make a robot arm but I need to figure out a few things before I build it like how large should it be desk sized or big enough to reach all over. How many degrees of freedom the arm should have. lastly if I should give the arm a camera so it could use media pipe or something to track movements and to know what its picking up.
