# Intelligent Robotic Arm MK2  

## Overview  
This project is a 3D-printed robotic arm equipped with **AI-powered vision** and a **distance sensor** for responsive, semi-autonomous operation. It combines servo-based motion control with modern computer vision to detect objects, estimate distance, and interact intelligently with its surroundings. The design emphasizes accessibility, modularity, and hands-on experimentation with AI-driven robotics.  

## Key Features  
- **AI Vision System:** Runs on a Raspberry Pi with a camera for real-time object and gesture recognition.  
- **Distance Sensing:** Ultrasonic or laser sensor for obstacle detection and spatial awareness.  
- **Modular 3D-Printed Design:** Lightweight, customizable, and easy to assemble or upgrade.  
- **Microcontroller Control:** Uses Arduino or Teensy boards with optional PCA9685 servo drivers.  
- **Upgradeable Platform:** Expandable for voice interaction, sensor feedback, or ML-based behavior.  

## Assembly Notes  
1. Calibrate all servos to their neutral position before mounting.  
2. Print parts in Pla or Petg with 20â€“30% infill for strength and precision.  
3. Mount the camera securely in the mount with a clear field of view.  
4. Use 18-20 AWG wire for servo power and provide regulated logic power separately.
5. Test and align the distance sensor for optimal range and orientation before integration.
